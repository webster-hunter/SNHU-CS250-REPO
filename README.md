1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  The first step to interpreting user needs should involve discussion with the scrum team and the client. Using the clients input regarding the software's appearance and required functionality, the team should begin to determine the order in which to implement features. In doing this, the features are segmented into user stories. User stories are helpful to the development of the product as they are often designed to provide the details of the desired functionality, the size of the undertaking development, and requirements that indicate whether or not the story is ready for deployment. 
  
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  
  The start of development should always be a sort of discovery process. What feaures are required? What pitfalls should be avoided? What is the audience? Before any actual development begins, there should be very ambiguity in response to these questions. Following this, a development model should be decided on. While this class heavily focused on the Agile methodology, there are many factors that go into determining how development should be structured that may result in deciding against Agile. 
  
  Agile includes many methods that make up the overall structure of the methodology. Below are some of the most critial (in my opinion) and some of what they contribute:
  -Development in Scrum Teams: Encourages individual contributions and accountability. Provides continuous feedback.
  -Feature Driven Development: Progress tracking is made easier. Scales well to large teams.
  -Extreme Flexibility: Changes can be made very late in the development process, but this can make deadlines less clear.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  In order to be a good team member, you should try to embody many important traits. First, you should be approachable and friendly. When working in a development team, you should be able to have your team members come to you for advice as well as be capable of approaching others when you reach a roadblock. Second, you need to be an effective communicator. When it comes time for a group meeting, you must feel confident enough to voice your opinions and concerns with the progress the team has made and the direction the project is going. Third (but arguably the most important), you must be goal oriented and motivated. A team is ultimately a collection of individuals, and one person pushing themselves can make a significant difference in team motivation, productivity, and morale.
